# Simple State Machine

## Description

This repo has code for basic finite-state-machine. It was created purely for the purpose of learning. I followed a [post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/implementing-a-simple-state-machine-library-in-javascript) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/about/) to create this simple state-machine.

I have implemented below state-machines as an exercise for the tutorial -

1. [Switch State Machine](./src/example-state-machines/switch-state-machine/switch-state-machine.md)
1. [Coin-Operated Turnstile State Machine](./src/example-state-machines/coin-operated-turnstile-state-machine/coin-operated-turnstile-state-machine.md)
